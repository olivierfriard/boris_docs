# Starting BORIS


Once installed BORIS can be launched by clicking on its icon.


For launching BORIS from sources see the [Run BORIS from source code](https://www.boris.unito.it/pages/run_from_source_code.html) section.


!!! note "First launch"

    The first launch of BORIS can take some time to show up. Please be patient!

The main window of BORIS will show up. All commands of the toolbar are disabled for now except the `Preferences` button.
